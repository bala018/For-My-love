        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            It all started with something so small… a simple moment that didn’t
            seem important at the time. I didn’t know that one moment would
            slowly grow into something that would change the way my heart feels,
            the way my days begin, and the way my nights end. I didn’t know that
            you would become someone my heart would hold onto so deeply.<br /><br />

            At first, you were just a part of my day. Someone I talked to,
            someone who made ordinary moments feel lighter. But slowly, without
            any effort, without any warning, you became more. You became the
            first thought that crossed my mind when I woke up, and the last
            thought that stayed with me before I fell asleep. Somewhere between
            all the conversations, laughter, and quiet moments… my heart found
            you, and it never wanted to let go.<br /><br />

            There was no exact moment I can point to. No single second where
            everything suddenly changed. It happened in silence. It happened
            naturally. You became my habit, my comfort, and my peace. You became
            the person my heart trusted without fear. The person whose presence
            alone could calm everything inside me.<br /><br />

            You came into my life and filled spaces I didn’t even know were
            empty. You brought a kind of happiness I had never known before. Not
            loud happiness, not temporary happiness… but a quiet, deep happiness
            that stays and grows stronger with every passing day. The kind of
            happiness that makes everything else feel less heavy.<br /><br />

            There were nights when we talked and lost track of time, when
            nothing else in the world mattered except that moment. There were
            also silent moments, where even without words, your presence meant
            everything to me. And in those moments, I realized something I could
            never ignore… my heart had already chosen you.<br /><br />

            Even with distance between us, you never truly felt far away.
            Because somehow, you were always with me. In my thoughts, in my
            heart, in every small moment of my day. You became my strength when
            I felt weak, my calm when everything felt uncertain, and my reason
            to smile even on difficult days.<br /><br />

            And now, March 23 has become more than just a date. It has become
            the moment my heart has been quietly waiting for. The moment I
            finally get to stand in front of you. The moment I finally get to
            see you not as a dream, not as a thought, but as real. The moment
            distance stops being distance.<br /><br />

            I don’t know what I will say when I see you. I don’t know if words
            will come easily. But I know my heart will recognize you instantly.
            Because it always has. Because in ways I cannot explain, my heart
            has always felt connected to yours.<br /><br />

            You are not just someone who came into my life. You became the most
            meaningful part of it. You became my peace in chaos, my light in
            darkness, and my comfort in silence. You became the person who made
            my world feel complete without even trying.<br /><br />

            You changed me in the most beautiful way. You taught my heart how to
            feel deeply, how to trust fully, and how to love honestly. And no
            matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, one truth will
            always remain inside me… my heart chose you, and it will continue
            choosing you, every single day.<br /><br />

            You are not just part of my story… you are the most beautiful
            chapter of my life. And on March 23, I finally get to stand in front
            of the love my heart has known for so long.<br /><br />

            And in that moment, without needing words, my heart will quietly say
            what it has always known… that you are my love, my peace, and my
            forever. ❤️
          </p>
          <p>
            It all started with a moment that became the beginning of something
            truly beautiful. From that point on, everything began to feel
            different in the most meaningful way. My heart found something real,
            something calm, something it wanted to hold close every single
            day.<br /><br />

            Slowly and naturally, you became the first thought that crossed my
            mind when I woke up, and the last thought that stayed with me before
            I fell asleep. Somewhere between all the conversations, laughter,
            and quiet moments… my heart found you, and it never wanted to let
            go.<br /><br />

            There was no single moment where everything changed — it grew
            steadily, peacefully, and truly. You became my habit, my comfort,
            and my peace. You became the person my heart trusted completely. The
            person whose presence alone could calm everything inside me.<br /><br />

            You came into my life and filled it with warmth, meaning, and a kind
            of happiness that feels deep and lasting. Not loud or temporary, but
            quiet and certain — a happiness that stays and grows stronger with
            every passing day. The kind of happiness that makes everything feel
            right.<br /><br />

            There were nights when we talked and lost track of time, when
            nothing else mattered except that moment we shared. There were also
            quiet moments where even without words, your presence meant
            everything to me. And in those moments, my heart only grew more sure
            of you.<br /><br />

            Even with distance between us, you have always felt close. You are
            with me in my thoughts, in my heart, and in every part of my day.
            You became my strength, my calm, and my reason to smile in ways that
            feel natural and true.<br /><br />

            And now, March 23 has become more than just a date. It is the moment
            my heart has been waiting for — the moment I finally get to stand in
            front of you, to see you, and to be near you. The moment everything
            we have felt becomes something we can hold, see, and live
            together.<br /><br />

            I don’t know what words I will say when I see you, but I know my
            heart will recognize you instantly. Because it always has. Because
            in every way that matters, my heart has always felt connected to
            yours.<br /><br />

            You are not just someone who came into my life. You became the most
            meaningful part of it. You became my peace in chaos, my light in
            darkness, and my comfort in silence. You became the person who makes
            my world feel complete.<br /><br />

            You changed me in the most beautiful way. You taught my heart how to
            feel deeply, how to trust fully, and how to love honestly. And no
            matter where life takes us, one truth will always remain — my heart
            chose you, and it will continue choosing you, every single day.<br /><br />

            You are not just part of my story… you are the most beautiful
            chapter of my life. And on March 23, I finally get to stand in front
            of the love my heart has known for so long.<br /><br />
